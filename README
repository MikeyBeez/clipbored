NAME
    clipbored - continuously collects all selections in Xorg's clipboard
    buffers

SYNOPSIS
      clipbored [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
    clipbored is a daemon that continuously grabs all non-duplicate
    selections in the X.org clipboard buffers and writes them to a plaintext
    history file for later use.

    There are several scripts distributed with clipbored that'll use the
    history file for different purposes.

  Scripts
      dmenurl   - launch dmenu with all previously yanked URLs for you to select
                  from.

      dmenuclip - launch dmenu listing all previously clipboarded content

OPTIONS
      -l,   --last        show the n latest additions
      -c,   --clear       clear all history
      -n,   --no-daemon   do not detach from the shell
      -k,   --kill        kill a running clipbored session
      -h,   --help        show this help
      -m,   --man         display the manual

ENVIRONMENT
    The history file location is $XDG_DATA_HOME/clipbored/clips

    The X selection to use can be specified by setting the
    CLIPBORED_X_SELECTION environment variable.

    If unset, or set to *primary* , text is grabbed from the XA_PRIMARY
    buffer. When text is selected with the mouse, or piped through
    xclip/xsel with zero arguments, it ends up here. This is most likely
    what you want.

    If set to *clipboard*, text is grabbed from the XA_CLIPBOARD buffer.
    Data ends up in this buffer when an explicit action is taken to cut/copy
    text; used in many GUI environments.

    To the best of my knowledge, the *secondary* buffer is rarely used at
    all.

    The helper scripts can read properties from environment variables. These
    are recognized:

      CLIPBORED_DMENU_LISTMODE    regular/vertical
      CLIPBORED_DMENU_NORMAL_FG   foreground color in HEX
      CLIPBORED_DMENU_NORMAL_BG   background color in HEX
      CLIPBORED_DMENU_SELECT_FG   selected item background color in HEX
      CLIPBORED_DMENU_SELECT_BG   selected item foreground color in HEX
      CLIPBORED_DMENU_FONT        font that will be used
      CLIPBORED_DMENU_LINES       how many lines that will be shown in vertical mode

CONTRIBUTORS
    Markus Xously suggested we should be able to pick the clipboard buffer
    to use. Since I very rarely use any GUI applications, I wasn't aware of
    the fact that when CTRL+C/CTRL+V etc is used, it goes into the
    XA_CLIPBOARD buffer instead of the XA_PRIMARY, probably rendering
    clipbored somewhat useless to the users using these types of
    applications. :)
